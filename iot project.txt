ðŸ“ŒProject Title: IoT-Based Smart Classroom System 

ðŸ“ŒDESCRAPTION : The IoT-Based Smart Classroom System is designed to enhance the learning environment by integrating various IoT technologies. This project typically involves the use of Arduino as the primary microcontroller, along with various sensors and modules to create an interactive and automated classroom experience.

ðŸ“ŒKey Components Used

 ðŸ“ŒArduino Board
  âœ…Acts as the central controller for the system.
  âœ…Commonly used boards include Arduino Uno, Mega, or Nano.

ðŸ“ŒSensors
 âœ…Temperature and Humidity Sensor (DHT11/DHT22): Monitors classroom climate.
 âœ…Light Sensor (LDR): Adjusts lighting based on ambient light levels.
 âœ…PIR Motion Sensor: Detects presence in the classroom for automation.

ðŸ“ŒActuators
 âœ…Relay Module: Controls devices like fans, lights, and projectors.
 âœ…Servo Motors: Can be used for automated blinds or other mechanical systems.

ðŸ“ŒCommunication Modules:
  âœ…Wi-Fi Module (ESP8266/ESP32): Connects the system to the internet for remote monitoring and control.
  âœ…Bluetooth Module (HC-05): Allows local control via smartphones.

ðŸ“ŒPower Supply
 âœ…Adequate power supply for Arduino and connected components.

ðŸ“ŒSoftware Used

ðŸ“ŒArduino IDE
  âœ…The primary software for programming the Arduino board.
  âœ…Supports C/C++ programming languages.

ðŸ“ŒBlynk
  âœ… A mobile application that allows users to create a user interface for the IoT project.
  âœ…Enables remote monitoring and control of classroom devices.

ðŸ“ŒLibraries
  âœ…Various libraries for sensors and modules (e.g., `DHT`, `WiFi`, `Blynk` libraries) to simplify coding.

ðŸ“ŒBasic Code StructureðŸ“Œ

âœ…Hereâ€™s a simple example of how the code might look for reading temperature and humidity and sending it to Blynk:

```cpp
#include <DHT.h>
#include <BlynkSimpleEsp8266.h>

#define DHTPIN 2     // Pin where the DHT sensor is connected
#define DHTTYPE DHT11   // DHT 11

DHT dht(DHTPIN, DHTTYPE);

char auth[] = "YourBlynkAuthToken"; // Blynk Auth Token
char ssid[] = "YourNetworkName";     // Your WiFi SSID
char pass[] = "YourNetworkPassword";  // Your WiFi Password

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  Blynk.begin(auth, ssid, pass);
  dht.begin();
}

void loop() {
  Blynk.run();
  
  float h = dht.readHumidity();
  float t = dht.readTemperature();

  if (isnan(h) || isnan(t)) {
    Serial.println("Failed to read from DHT sensor!");
    return;
  }

  Blynk.virtualWrite(V0, h); // Send humidity to Blynk
  Blynk.virtualWrite(V1, t); // Send temperature to Blynk

  delay(2000); // Wait for 2 seconds before next reading
}
```

ðŸ“ŒConclusion
âœ…The IoT-Based Smart Classroom System leverages Arduino and various sensors to create an interactive learning environment. By using software like the Arduino IDE and Blynk, you can easily monitor and control classroom conditions, enhancing the overall educational experience.
